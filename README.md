# Challenge2026
# AI Impact Challenge 2026

**Weekly AI-for-Good projects for professionals who want to create real impact — one week at a time.**


> "Build something that matters. Every single week in 2026."

### Why This Challenge Exists
Most AI challenges are toy problems.  
This one is different: **every week you ship a prototype that can actually help people or the planet**.

- 52 weeks = 52 deployable open-source tools  
- Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals  
- Beginner-to-advanced friendly (Colab → production)  
- Community showcase + potential accelerator / grant exposure

### How It Works
1. **Every Monday** a new challenge drops (or use the list below).
2. You have 7 days to build a **working prototype**.
3. Requirements (minimum):
   - Public GitHub repo with code + Gradio/Streamlit demo
   - README with impact statement + dataset sources
   - One blog post or LinkedIn/X thread (#AIImpact2026)
4. Submit via PR to the `/solutions` folder or just tag the repo.
5. Top projects every quarter get featured + possible funding intros.
